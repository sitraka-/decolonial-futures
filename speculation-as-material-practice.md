<aside class="notes">
- Hello, my name is Sitraka Rakotoniaina.<br>
- I’m an artist-designer originally from Madagascar, now based in London.<br>
- I lecture at Central Saint Martins in MA Industrial Design and MA Narrative Environments.<br>
- I also teach at the London College of Fashion in MA Fashion Futures, and at Goldsmiths in MA Design Expanded Practice.<br>
- Outside of teaching, I run a small research and design studio called Very Very Far Away (VVFA).<br>
- And in parallel, I’m doing a PhD in Design at UAL.<br><br>
- Today, I’ll sketch four short segments on speculation:<br>
- First, the scope I’m interested in when it comes to speculative design practices.<br>
- Second, a framework I use with my students called *critical fables*.<br>
- Third, how speculation becomes a method for *practising friction*.<br>
- And finally, I’ll briefly share some outcomes and methods that emerge from these practices.

    - I want to begin with a certain tension in the way speculative futures are often imagined — especially in design.

    <aside class="notes">
    - There is a tendency to project forward using the forms and systems we already know. To treat the future as something to be rendered in detail, filled in with familiar logics: private property, zoning, productivity, control. These visions appear expansive, but they often narrow what is possible, replicating the very hierarchies they claim to move beyond.<br><br>
    - One image that that get shared over and over from Blue Origin's remake of O'neil's space settlements is the "space elk". There was something strangely deeply absurd. If this is our cosmic imaginary, then what exactly are we rehearsing?

    - What interests me is not just what these projections depict, but what they quietly assume. The agricultural systems, the infrastructure, the division of labour — all lifted more or less unchanged. The farms are still monocultures. The workers still shift-based. Gravity itself is faked so that business-as-usual can continue uninterrupted.<br><br>
    - Even when framed as radical or off-world, these speculative futures continue to be tethered to deeply terrestrial logics. They present the new as a continuity of the same: technocratic control, extractive models, and spatial segregation dressed up in utopian skins.

 <aside class="notes">
    - This repetition isn’t exclusive to outer space. It exists in the way infrastructures on Earth have long been used to shape access, visibility, and value.<br>
    - A well-known example is Robert Moses’s parkway designs in New York. He built bridges deliberately low so that buses — and by extension, the people who relied on them — couldn’t pass through. What looked like a neutral engineering choice was in fact a form of social exclusion, making segregation feel like a natural outcome of infrastructure. Design here doesn’t simply respond to needs — it draws boundaries, filters bodies, encodes decisions. <br><br>
  </aside>

<section data-background-image="assets/imgs/cb2.jpg" data-state=cb1>
    <span class="quotes">The design process itself—beyond its final outcome—embodies and perpetuates power structures and ideologies. Through its functional, infrastructural, symbolic, and normative aspects, it establishes standards and normalises behaviours and practices.</span>
    <aside class="notes">
    - Much like metaphors can create "pictures" or conceptual frameworks that orient thinking, design functions as both an instrument and an infrastructure that shapes our aesthetic relations to the world. <br><br>
    - And by aesthetic, I don’t just mean the way things look, but the ways we perceive, sense, and experience the world around us.<br><br>
    - In essence, design is both a product of worldviews—reflecting existing ideologies—and a tool that frames and narrows but also possibly broadens how people construct new ones.

<section data-background-image="assets/imgs/cb2.jpg" data-state=cb1>
    <span class="quotes">Design serves as both an instrument of control<br>and a force that shapes what is considered<br><em>natural or inevitable.</em></span>
    <aside class="notes">
    - And this duality allows design to both reinforce or challenge, enhance or disrupt existing perspectives.<br><br>
    - So obviously design is never neutral. Every object, system, and interface carries with it the values, ideologies, and intentions of the forces that bring it into being. It is both an instrument of control and a agent that shapes what we come to see as natural or inevitable. <br><br>
    - So my work explores this duality, focusing on how it mediates our understanding of worlds, particularly when we extend our imaginations to outer space.

    <aside class="notes">
    - When thinking about approaches that imagine and experiment with alternative ways of being—rather than simply replicating existing structures in new contexts—Lisa Messeri’s use of material instantiation is particularly compelling. <br><br>
    - In her discussion of scientists working at the Mars Desert Research Station, she highlights how data becomes infused with narrative possibilities, turning raw information into rich stories. She frames this as a juxtaposition of Mars and Earth—two distinct places coexisting in the same space. <br><br>
    - Which creates a scenario where the boundaries between the two begin to blur, leading to a unique encounter of the real and the speculative.

    - As these two environments overlap, they generate a dynamic space— a kind of “third space”—where new relationships, dynamics, and rituals emerge. One example could be the simple yet telling act of using your tongue, to move around a tissue to wipe condensation from the inside of a helmet.

    <aside class="notes">
    - So from this interplay of imaginaries, worldviews, and designs may emerge the potential for alternatives. Design, in this sense, is already an ethnographic act—it reads and reshapes the world simultaneously, working through gestures, objects, and forms that both reflect and construct ways of living. I’m interested in design as speculative ethnographies—as a way to bring these dynamics into tangible form, reconstructing culture by blending heritage and fiction to reimagine what is possible, often as a way to assert agency over dominant narratives.

<section data-state=hg data-background-image="assets/imgs/hiragasy_.png">
    <aside class="notes">
    - One example of this is the Hira Gasy. A traditional Malagasy performance that I use as an example of speculative ethnography in practice. Costumes from the Merina Kingdom of the 19th century drew on European military attire—jackets, trousers, and sashes.<br><br>
    - But they weren’t just copies. Instead, they were reinterpreted, woven with bold Malagasy patterns and colours that turned symbols of colonial authority into something uniquely local as an expression of identity and autonomy. <br><br>
    - Here, the Merina engaged in a speculative reimagining of ‘Europeanness,’ using design to assert cultural agency and resist imposed narratives.

    <aside class="notes">
    - In a different take on speculative ethnography, Ursula Le Guin and Todd Barton’s Music and Poetry of the Kesh uses fiction. Created alongside Le Guin’s novel Always Coming Home, It was a recording on a cassette tape that brought to life the Kesh—a fictional community in post-apocalyptic Northern California—through their songs, poems, and spoken word. <br><br>
    - The Kesh’s culture, shaped by communal values and deep ties to the land, is also realised not only through narrative but through maps, recipes, and artefacts.

    <aside class="notes">
    - Thinking about imagined cultures and how they are brought to life, I want to briefly talk about a panel discussion I organised with NSPDOS as part of the Virtual Italian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale of Architecture in 2021. Titled Human Consideration: Speculation on Lunar Habitation, this event brought together an architect, a litterature scholar, and an anthropologist—to explore the social, architectural, and communal realities of long-term life on the Moon.<br><br>
    - Rather than treating lunar habitation as purely an engineering challenge, NSPDOS developed a world-building premise, a stolen report from the year 2133, to reframe the problem. This allowed us to ask different kinds of questions: not just about survival, but about what kinds of societies and relationships could emerge in such an environment.<br><br>
    - From there, we charted a path toward exploring what it truly means to live beyond Earth—not just how it might work, but how it might shape existence itself.

<section data-background-image="assets/imgs/nspdos_2.png" data-state=nspdos>
    <aside class="notes">
    - Rather than constructing a world from the top down, I wanted to start from the small, the everyday—moments, interactions, and routines. Instead of defining a fully built setting, I structured the discussion around specific situations, prompting the panel to generate stories from them and letting the world emerge through those narratives.<br><br>
  </aside>
</section>

<section data-background-image="assets/imgs/1999.jpg" data-state=nspdos>
    <aside class="notes">
    - From these discussions, a series of key ideas emerged like:<br><br>
    - Designing for the Moon is not just about infrastructure—it’s about shaping entirely new ways of living. The built environment, policies, and governance structures don’t just determine survival; they actively shape social relationships, rhythms of life, and cultural values. On the Moon, everything is extreme—gravity, resources, isolation—which means that every design decision has consequences beyond function.<br><br>
    - For example, the way time is structured can reshape daily life. Instead of Earth’s standard 8-hour work-rest cycles, a lunar society could be structured around different hour blocks<br><br>
    - Health and safety policies could take on a new role. If survival depends on mutual aid, could an obligation to provide assistance—which is the terms used in treaties like the Outer Space Treaty—extend beyond emergencies to include resource sharing, like calories or radiation shielding? Could architecture itself embed these principles, where handrails, airlocks, or shared oxygen systems aren’t just practical necessities, but enforcers of interdependence?<br><br>

    <aside class="notes">
    - Across these examples, what becomes clear is that imagining otherwise doesn’t require clean slates.  <br><br>
    - It happens through reinterpretation, recontextualisation, and sometimes contradiction.  <br><br>
    - The Merina uniforms are colonial and subversive. The Kesh are fictional but made tactile and audible. The Moon scenarios rely on infrastructure but point toward ritual and interdependence.  <br><br>
    - These tensions are not obstacles — they’re conditions.  <br><br>
    - This leads to a shift in focus — toward the role of misalignment, difficulty, and interference in practice itself.  <br><br>
    - Where friction is not something to be resolved, but a site of enquiry.<br><br>

    <aside class="notes">
    - As a follow up to this project, I started designing and building objects as simulations to capture some of these ideas, not in practice but in potential.<br><br> So learning to moonwalk tries to stage a collision between earthly constraint and lunar myth. Built around a mechanical contraption that mimics the unstable bounce of moonwalking, it invites the body into an awkward, uneven gait—not to simulate the Moon, but to inhabit the gap between imagination and gravity.<br><br>Speculation is a method to rehearse another way of moving, and thinking. And by performing misalignment, the work tries to open up questions about infrastructure, access, and the systems we build around our bodies<br><br>
