    <aside class="notes">
    I’m not interested in imagination as something separate from systems, a poetic aside to technical function, decorative or symbolic. Instead, I like to explore how imaginaries are woven into the fabric of systems: in machines that shape how we move, in tools that derive sounds and tracks from what we see.They shape what is designed, what is excluded, and what is made operational. A gesture, a sound, a rhythm can all be the outputs of logics inherited from elsewhere: scientific infrastructures, computational training sets, embedded values coded into how things function. Obviously, design does not sit outside these structures, it works within them by reinforcing their assumptions or twisting their logic. in other words, systems are carriers of worldview. They embed logic, hierarchy, narrative. To design a system is to give form to an imaginary, to make it operational.</aside>

    <aside class="notes">
        I’m not interested in cosmologies as abstract belief systems floating above the world. Every cosmology is material not only in objects or artefacts, but in how it arranges life, bodies, actions. What matters is the affordances it enables, the behaviours it scripts, the relations it structures. Even a policy has material consequences; it shapes who can move, who can breathe, who can speak. Even digital materials like data sets, interfaces, code, carry cosmological weight, shaping how the world is sensed, categorised, or made actionable. Materials are not passive carriers of meaning; they are active participants in how cosmologies are enacted and felt. I'm interested in exploringe how ideas emerge through materials, and how materials carry, distort, or resist those ideas.

    <aside class="notes">
        Speculations are not departures from reality, but ways of working within it differently. By imagining the world otherwise, we expose the assumptions that structure the present. A shift in movement, a distortion of sound, an unfamiliar interface—these speculative gestures do not point toward distant futures. They ask what becomes visible when something breaks, when the normal is unsettled. The work I'll be showing tries to engage with these tensions: navigating machine-trained latent spaces, building contraptions that rehearse impossible movements, and constructing sonic systems that unsettle what is heard, recognised, or believed to be possible. These are not exercises in fiction, but negotiations between constraint and potential to stretch existing systems until their limits reveal the space for change.

    <aside class="notes">
    - Today, I want to discuss design as the practice of transmuting ideas into tangible realities, and a method for imagining and spawning worlds—and how this could shape the ways we may think and imagine outer space. <br><br>
    - As the stories we tell, the imaginaries we create, and the ideological projects we hold all seep into the objects and materials around us. <br><br>
    - And in turn, those materials shape how we see the world and imagine what’s possible, in this constant back-and-forth between ideas and things.<br><br>
    - I’ll start with examples that illustrate the key dimensions of design I am interested in, before moving onto discussing some of the methods I use to produce work. <br><br>
    - and at the end if there's still time I'll share a video I realised last year about a device that help simulates the feeling of moonwalking.

    <span class="quotes">The design process itself—beyond its final outcome—embodies and perpetuates power structures and ideologies. Through its functional, infrastructural, symbolic, and normative aspects, it establishes standards and normalises behaviours and practices.</span>
    <aside class="notes">
    - Much like metaphors can create "pictures" or conceptual frameworks that orient thinking, design functions as both an instrument and an infrastructure that shapes our aesthetic relations to the world. <br><br>
    - And by aesthetic, I don’t just mean the way things look, but the ways we perceive, sense, and experience the world around us.<br><br>
    - In essence, design is both a product of worldviews—reflecting existing ideologies—and a tool that frames and narrows but also possibly broadens how people construct new ones.

    <aside class="notes">
    - And this duality allows design to both reinforce or challenge, enhance or disrupt existing perspectives.<br><br>
    - So obviously design is never neutral. Every object, system, and interface carries with it the values, ideologies, and intentions of the forces that bring it into being. It is both an instrument of control and a agent that shapes what we come to see as natural or inevitable. <br><br>
    - So my work explores this duality, focusing on how it mediates our understanding of worlds, particularly when we extend our imaginations to outer space.

    - his work prevented buses—and therefore lower-income and predominantly minority communities—from accessing these public spaces. <br><br>
    - So his urban planning decisions enforced social control by building in stone who had access to certain spaces. So, these designs made segregation feel like a natural consequence of infrastructure, rather than an intentional act of exclusion.<br><br>

    - So by systematically recording the empire’s economic and social structures, the codex transforms that knowledge into a tool for control, turning what was meant as documentation into a means of exploitation.<br><br>

    - Every artefact, whether a chair, a bridge, or a spacecraft, participates in the shaping of societal values and power structures—and therefore reaffirms what we know: that design is inherently political. <br><br>
    - And that artefacts themselves have agency, influencing human behaviour and social structures beyond their intended use.

    - This is the commemorative plaque of the event, shaped like the APAS Airlock. APAS stands for Androgynous Peripheral Attach System. Beyond the symbolic image of two superpowers able to collaborate together for the greater good of sicence despite the Cold War, both made the considered decision to get rid of the male and female parts in their docking system, a preemptive adjustment to avoid diplomatic penetration which could be seen as a sign of submission or weakness. <br><br>
    - Deeper social norms and logics directly influenced the technical design, showing that even seemingly neutral engineering decisions are deeply intertwined with social and political forces.

    - Design is an assemblage—a dynamic constellation of ideas, practices, technologies, and social norms. It is never a singular object or process but a convergence of multiple forces, as seen in the APAS system, where political tensions, cultural anxieties, and technical requirements were all entangled in the final design.

    <span class="quotes">Design approaches <em>[...]</em> are critical, activist, organic, and political; they are about thinkering (thinking with your hands, doing hands-on conceptual work), about problem finding and problem framing more than problem solving, and about functional social fictions rather than science fiction;</span>
    <aside class="notes">
    - So design poiesis frames design’s transformative nature not as problem-solving, but as a way of reshaping meaning and relations. In this spirit, Arturo Escobar, paraphrasing Paola Antonelli, captures this potential:<br><br>
    - Design approaches like this are critical, activist, and political. They emphasise thinkering—thinking through making—where hands-on experimentation shapes ideas. It’s less about solving problems and more about discovering and reframing them. This resonates with critical making, where the process of crafting itself becomes a tool for questioning and imagining, creating functional social fictions that challenge existing realities or produce speculation grounded in real social and material conditions.

    - When thinking about approaches that imagine and experiment with alternative ways of being—rather than simply replicating existing structures in new contexts—Lisa Messeri’s use of material instantiation is particularly compelling. <br><br>
    -In her discussion of scientists working at the Mars Desert Research Station, she highlights how data becomes infused with narrative possibilities, turning raw information into rich stories. She frames this as a juxtaposition of Mars and Earth—two distinct places coexisting in the same space. <br><br>
    - Which creates a scenario where the boundaries between the two begin to blur, leading to a unique encounter of the real and the speculative.
