    <aside class="notes">
    I’m not interested in imagination as something separate from systems, a poetic aside to technical function, decorative or symbolic. Instead, I like to explore how imaginaries are woven into the fabric of systems: in machines that shape how we move, in tools that derive sounds and tracks from what we see.They shape what is designed, what is excluded, and what is made operational. A gesture, a sound, a rhythm can all be the outputs of logics inherited from elsewhere: scientific infrastructures, computational training sets, embedded values coded into how things function. Obviously, design does not sit outside these structures, it works within them by reinforcing their assumptions or twisting their logic. in other words, systems are carriers of worldview. They embed logic, hierarchy, narrative. To design a system is to give form to an imaginary, to make it operational.</aside>

    <aside class="notes">
        I’m not interested in cosmologies as abstract belief systems floating above the world. Every cosmology is material not only in objects or artefacts, but in how it arranges life, bodies, actions. What matters is the affordances it enables, the behaviours it scripts, the relations it structures. Even a policy has material consequences; it shapes who can move, who can breathe, who can speak. Even digital materials like data sets, interfaces, code, carry cosmological weight, shaping how the world is sensed, categorised, or made actionable. Materials are not passive carriers of meaning; they are active participants in how cosmologies are enacted and felt. I'm interested in exploringe how ideas emerge through materials, and how materials carry, distort, or resist those ideas.

    <aside class="notes">
        Speculations are not departures from reality, but ways of working within it differently. By imagining the world otherwise, we expose the assumptions that structure the present. A shift in movement, a distortion of sound, an unfamiliar interface—these speculative gestures do not point toward distant futures. They ask what becomes visible when something breaks, when the normal is unsettled. The work I'll be showing tries to engage with these tensions: navigating machine-trained latent spaces, building contraptions that rehearse impossible movements, and constructing sonic systems that unsettle what is heard, recognised, or believed to be possible. These are not exercises in fiction, but negotiations between constraint and potential to stretch existing systems until their limits reveal the space for change.

    <aside class="notes">
    - Today, I want to discuss design as the practice of transmuting ideas into tangible realities, and a method for imagining and spawning worlds—and how this could shape the ways we may think and imagine outer space. <br><br>
    - As the stories we tell, the imaginaries we create, and the ideological projects we hold all seep into the objects and materials around us. <br><br>
    - And in turn, those materials shape how we see the world and imagine what’s possible, in this constant back-and-forth between ideas and things.<br><br>
    - I’ll start with examples that illustrate the key dimensions of design I am interested in, before moving onto discussing some of the methods I use to produce work. <br><br>
    - and at the end if there's still time I'll share a video I realised last year about a device that help simulates the feeling of moonwalking.

    <aside class="notes">
    - Much like metaphors can create "pictures" or conceptual frameworks that orient thinking, design functions as both an instrument and an infrastructure that shapes our aesthetic relations to the world. <br><br>
    - And by aesthetic, I don’t just mean the way things look, but the ways we perceive, sense, and experience the world around us.<br><br>
    - In essence, design is both a product of worldviews—reflecting existing ideologies—and a tool that frames and narrows but also possibly broadens how people construct new ones.

    <aside class="notes">
    - And this duality allows design to both reinforce or challenge, enhance or disrupt existing perspectives.<br><br>
    - So obviously design is never neutral. Every object, system, and interface carries with it the values, ideologies, and intentions of the forces that bring it into being. It is both an instrument of control and a agent that shapes what we come to see as natural or inevitable. <br><br>
    - So my work explores this duality, focusing on how it mediates our understanding of worlds, particularly when we extend our imaginations to outer space.

    - So design poiesis frames design’s transformative nature not as problem-solving, but as a way of reshaping meaning and relations. In this spirit, Arturo Escobar, paraphrasing Paola Antonelli, captures this potential:<br><br>
    - Design approaches like this are critical, activist, and political. They emphasise thinkering—thinking through making—where hands-on experimentation shapes ideas. It’s less about solving problems and more about discovering and reframing them. This resonates with critical making, where the process of crafting itself becomes a tool for questioning and imagining, creating functional social fictions that challenge existing realities or produce speculation grounded in real social and material conditions.

    - So from this interplay of imaginaries, worldviews, and designs may emerge the potential for alternatives.

    - But they weren’t just copies. Instead, they were reinterpreted, woven with bold Malagasy patterns and colours that turned symbols of colonial authority into something uniquely local as an expression of identity and autonomy. <br><br>

    <aside class="notes">
    - Thinking about imagined cultures and how they are brought to life, I want to briefly introduce a panel discussion I organised with NSPDOS as part of the Virtual Italian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale of Architecture in 2021. Titled Human Consideration: Speculation on Lunar Habitation, this event brought together an eclectic group of thinkers—an architect, a litterature scholar, and an anthropologist—to explore the social, architectural, and communal realities of long-term life on the Moon.<br><br>
    - Rather than treating lunar habitation as purely an engineering challenge, NSPDOS developed a world-building premise, a stolen report from the year 2133, to reframe the problem. This allowed us to ask different kinds of questions: not just about survival, but about what kinds of societies and relationships could emerge in such an environment.<br><br>
    - From there, we charted a path toward exploring what it truly means to live beyond Earth—not just how it might work, but how it might shape existence itself.

    - Rather than constructing a world from the top down, I wanted to start from the small, the everyday—moments, interactions, and routines. Instead of defining a fully built setting, I structured the discussion around specific situations, prompting the panel to generate stories from them and letting the world emerge through those narratives.<br><br>

<section data-background-image="assets/imgs/1999.jpg" data-state=nspdos>
    <aside class="notes">
    - From these discussions, a series of key ideas emerged, and I’m going to share some of them here.<br><br>
    - Designing for the Moon is not just about infrastructure—it’s about shaping entirely new ways of living. The built environment, policies, and governance structures don’t just determine survival; they actively shape social relationships, rhythms of life, and cultural values. On the Moon, everything is extreme—gravity, resources, isolation—which means that every design decision has consequences beyond function.<br><br>

For example, the way time is structured can reshape daily life. Instead of Earth’s standard 8-hour work-rest cycles, a lunar society could be structured around different hour blocks, balancing community contributions with self-determined time. <br><br>

Health and safety policies also take on a new role. If survival depends on mutual aid, could an obligation to provide assistance—enshrined in treaties like the Outer Space Treaty—extend beyond emergencies to include resource sharing, like calories or radiation shielding? Could architecture itself embed these principles, where handrails, airlocks, or shared oxygen systems aren’t just practical necessities, but enforcers of interdependence?<br><br>

And by performing misalignment, the work tries to open up questions about infrastructure, access, and the systems we build around our bodies<br><br>

    An ongoing experiment in translating visual detection into real-time sound.
Developed through several iterations, including a version made for a collaboration with Nick Mortimer, this project uses object detection to generate MIDI-based audio directly from video input. Objects don’t produce symbolic meaning—they become active agents in a system that reads space, motion, and form as sonic events. The result isn’t a soundtrack but a live perceptual system: one that operates in the space between recognition and interpretation, generating a new logic of association between what is seen and what is heard.

    Cosmic Tuner operates within the shared latent space of text, and sound—where machine-learned associations don’t just describe the world but produce new rules for what can be recognised, connected, or rendered sensible.<br><br>

Rather than searching for fixed outputs, the tuner explores what happens when these modalities misalign—where translation falters, or meaning becomes unresolvable. Inspired by the misreading of a word like “laughter” as a mechanical tick-tock, the project uses such slippages to trace the boundaries of machinic understanding.<br><br>

Here, speculation happens not through fiction, but through misrecognition—inhabiting the friction between statistical reasoning and human sense-making. The tuner does not decode meaning, but but tunes into that space where new worlds become momentarily audible, before disappearing again into noise.

    <aside class="notes">
    Latent space is a mathematical structure where a machine positions different types of data—like text, sound, or images—based on patterns it has learned from training. It’s a kind of semantic map, where things that the system understands as similar are placed close together, and dissimilar things are placed further apart.<br><br>

Although the space exists in hundreds of dimensions (often 512 or more), what we see is a compressed projection—reduced to two or three dimensions so we can visualise and navigate it. What we see is a fragment of some reality, a diagram of machine understanding: a model of what the system believes belongs together, what it thinks is meaningful, and where its sense-making starts to break down.
