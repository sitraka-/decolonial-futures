    <aside class="notes">
    “I’m not interested in imagination as something separate from systems — a poetic aside to technical function. Instead, I explore how imaginaries are woven into the very fabric of systems — whether in a sensing architecture, a user interface, or a sonic prosthesis. Systems are carriers of worldview. They embed logic, hierarchy, narrative. To design a system is to give form to an imaginary — to make it operational.”</aside>

    <aside class="notes">
        “I’m not interested in cosmologies as abstract belief systems floating above the world. Every cosmology is material — not just in objects or artefacts, but in how it arranges life, bodies, actions. Even a policy has material consequences — it shapes who can move, who can breathe, who can speak. In my work, I explore how ideas emerge through materials, and how materials carry, distort, or resist those ideas.”
