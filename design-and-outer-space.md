    <aside class="notes">
    - Today, I want to discuss design’s role as a translator that turns ideas into tangible realities, a creator of worlds—and how this shapes the ways we may think and imagine outer space. <br><br>
    - And I think this matters because the stories we tell, the imaginaries we create, and the ideological projects we hold all seep into the objects and materials around us. <br><br>
    - And in turn, those materials shape how we see the world and imagine what’s possible, in this constant back-and-forth between ideas and things.

    <span class="quotes">The design process itself—beyond its final outcome—embodies and perpetuates power structures and ideologies. Through its functional, infrastructural, symbolic, and normative aspects, it establishes standards and normalises behaviours and practices.</span>
    <aside class="notes">
    - Much like metaphors and language can create "pictures" or conceptual frameworks that constrain thinking, design functions as both an instrument and an infrastructure that shapes our aesthetic relations to the world. <br><br>
    - And by aesthetic, I don’t mean just what we may find visually pleasing—I mean the ways we perceive, sense, and experience the world around us.<br><br>
    - In essence, design is both a product of worldviews—reflecting existing ideologies—and a tool that frames and narrows or possibly broadens how people construct new ones.

    <span class="quotes">Design serves as both an instrument of control<br>and a force that shapes what is considered<br><em>natural or inevitable.</em></span>
    <aside class="notes">
    - And this duality allows design to both reinforce or challenge, enhance or disrupt existing perspectives.<br><br>
    - So obviously design is never neutral. Every object, system, and interface carries with it the values, ideologies, and intentions of its creators. It is both an instrument of control and a force that shapes what we come to see as natural or inevitable. <br><br>
    - And once again my work explores this duality, focusing on how it mediates our understanding of the world, particularly when we extend our imaginations to outer space.

    - Every artefact, whether a chair, a bridge, or a spacecraft, participates in the shaping of societal values and power structures—and therefore reaffirms what we know: that design is inherently political. <br><br>

 <aside class="notes">
    - The Kajaki Dam, built in the 1950s with U.S. funding to modernise Afghanistan, is a clear example of this. It was meant to provide irrigation and hydroelectric power, but it flooded large areas of farmland, displacing many local farmers. The new irrigation systems often favoured larger landowners, leaving small farmers struggling. With few other options, many turned to growing poppies, as the improved irrigation made the land ideal for cultivating this resilient and highly profitable crop, fueling the opium trade. Here, the dam becomes an agent in the socio-political landscape, enabling unforeseen consequences and reshaping realities.

    - This the commemorative plaque, shaped like the APAS Airlock. APAS stands for Androgynous Peripheral Attach System. Beyond the symbolic image of two superpowers able to collaborate together for the greater good of sicence despite the Cold War, both made the conscious decision to get rid of the male and female parts in their docking system, to prevent diplomatic penetration which could be seen as a sign of submission or weakness. <br><br>

    - Design is an assemblage—a dynamic constellation of ideas, practices, technologies, and social norms.

    - Design poiesis is transformative—it’s not only about producing artefacts, but about reshaping how we interact with and understand our world. In this spirit, Arturo Escobar, paraphrasing Paola Antonelli, captures this transformative potential:<br><br>
    - Design approaches like this are critical, activist, and political. They emphasise thinkering—thinking through making—where hands-on experimentation shapes ideas. It’s less about solving problems and more about discovering and reframing them. This resonates with critical making, where the process of crafting itself becomes a tool for questioning and imagining, creating functional social fictions that challenge existing realities or produce speculation grounded in real social and material conditions.
