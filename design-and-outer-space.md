    <aside class="notes">
    - Today, I want to discuss design as the practice of transmuting ideas into tangible realities, and a method for imagining and spawning worlds—and how this could shape the ways we may think and imagine outer space. <br><br>
    - As the stories we tell, the imaginaries we create, and the ideological projects we hold all seep into the objects and materials around us. <br><br>
    - And in turn, those materials shape how we see the world and imagine what’s possible, in this constant back-and-forth between ideas and things.<br><br>
    - I’ll start with examples that illustrate the key dimensions of design I am interested in, before moving onto discussing some of the methods I use to produce work. <br><br>
    - and at the end if there's still time I'll share a video I realised last year about a device that help simulates the feeling of moonwalking.

    <span class="quotes">The design process itself—beyond its final outcome—embodies and perpetuates power structures and ideologies. Through its functional, infrastructural, symbolic, and normative aspects, it establishes standards and normalises behaviours and practices.</span>
    <aside class="notes">
    - Much like metaphors can create "pictures" or conceptual frameworks that orient thinking, design functions as both an instrument and an infrastructure that shapes our aesthetic relations to the world. <br><br>
    - And by aesthetic, I don’t just mean the way things look, but the ways we perceive, sense, and experience the world around us.<br><br>
    - In essence, design is both a product of worldviews—reflecting existing ideologies—and a tool that frames and narrows but also possibly broadens how people construct new ones.

    <aside class="notes">
    - And this duality allows design to both reinforce or challenge, enhance or disrupt existing perspectives.<br><br>
    - So obviously design is never neutral. Every object, system, and interface carries with it the values, ideologies, and intentions of the forces that bring it into being. It is both an instrument of control and a agent that shapes what we come to see as natural or inevitable. <br><br>
    - So my work explores this duality, focusing on how it mediates our understanding of worlds, particularly when we extend our imaginations to outer space.

    - his work prevented buses—and therefore lower-income and predominantly minority communities—from accessing these public spaces. <br><br>
    - So his urban planning decisions enforced social control by building in stone who had access to certain spaces. So, these designs made segregation feel like a natural consequence of infrastructure, rather than an intentional act of exclusion.<br><br>

    - Every artefact, whether a chair, a bridge, or a spacecraft, participates in the shaping of societal values and power structures—and therefore reaffirms what we know: that design is inherently political. <br><br>

    - The Kajaki Dam, built in the 1950s with U.S. funding to modernise Afghanistan, is a clear example of this. It was meant to provide irrigation and hydroelectric power, but it flooded large areas of farmland, displacing many local farmers. The new irrigation systems often favoured larger landowners, leaving small farmers struggling. With few other options, many turned to growing poppies, as the improved irrigation made the land ideal for cultivating this resilient and highly profitable crop, fueling the opium trade. Here, the dam becomes an agent in the socio-political landscape, enabling unforeseen consequences and reshaping realities.

Beyond the symbolic image of two superpowers able to collaborate together for the greater good of sicence despite the Cold War, both made the considered decision to get rid of the male and female parts in their docking system, a preemptive adjustment to avoid diplomatic penetration which could be seen as a sign of submission or weakness. <br><br>

    - Design is an assemblage—a dynamic constellation of ideas, practices, technologies, and social norms.

    - So design poiesis frames design’s transformative nature not as problem-solving, but as a way of reshaping meaning and relations. In this spirit, Arturo Escobar, paraphrasing Paola Antonelli, captures this potential:<br><br>
    - Design approaches like this are critical, activist, and political. They emphasise thinkering—thinking through making—where hands-on experimentation shapes ideas. It’s less about solving problems and more about discovering and reframing them. This resonates with critical making, where the process of crafting itself becomes a tool for questioning and imagining, creating functional social fictions that challenge existing realities or produce speculation grounded in real social and material conditions.

    - When thinking about approaches that imagine and experiment with alternative ways of being—rather than simply replicating existing structures in new contexts—Lisa Messeri’s use of material instantiation is particularly compelling. <br><br>
    -In her discussion of scientists working at the Mars Desert Research Station, she highlights how data becomes infused with narrative possibilities, turning raw information into rich stories. She frames this as a juxtaposition of Mars and Earth—two distinct places coexisting in the same space. <br><br>

    - So from this interplay of imaginaries, worldviews, and designs emerges the potential for alternative, speculative worlds.

    - But they weren’t just copies. Instead, they were reinterpreted, woven with bold Malagasy patterns and colours that turned symbols of colonial authority into something uniquely local as an expression of identity and autonomy. <br><br>

    - Thinking about imagined cultures and how they are brought to life, I want to briefly introduce a panel discussion I organised with NSPDOS as part of the Virtual Italian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale of Architecture in 2021. Titled Human Consideration: Speculation on Lunar Habitation, this event brought together an eclectic group of thinkers—an architect, a litterature scholar, and an anthropologist—to explore the social, architectural, and communal realities of long-term life on the Moon.<br><br>
    - Rather than treating lunar habitation as purely an engineering challenge, NSPDOS developed a world-building premise, a stolen report from the year 2133, to reframe the problem. This allowed us to ask different kinds of questions: not just about survival, but about what kinds of societies and relationships could emerge in such an environment.<br><br>
    - From there, we charted a path toward exploring what it truly means to live beyond Earth—not just how it might work, but how it might shape existence itself.

    - Down to Earth → Connection, Status, and Identity <br><br>
    - "How does the Moon settlement relate to Earth? What does it mean to be a space settler?" Here, the focus was on Earth-Moon relations, from logistics (supplies, health monitoring, communication) to cultural identity—how Earthlings perceive the settlers, how they see themselves, and what it means to be “from” the Moon. This also touched on the long-term future—what happens after one has lived on the Moon, or for those who are born there?

    <aside class="notes">
    - From these discussions, a series of key ideas emerged, and I’m going to share some of them here.<br><br>
    - Designing for the Moon is not just about infrastructure—it’s about shaping entirely new ways of living. The built environment, policies, and governance structures don’t just determine survival; they actively shape social relationships, rhythms of life, and cultural values. On the Moon, everything is extreme—gravity, resources, isolation—which means that every design decision has consequences beyond function.<br><br>

For example, the way time is structured can reshape daily life. Instead of Earth’s standard 8-hour work-rest cycles, a lunar society could be structured around 6-hour blocks, balancing community contributions with self-determined time. Similarly, the Moon’s 15-day night cycle opens opportunities for nocturnal cultures, turning social life and tourism into an economic force.<br><br>

Health and safety policies also take on a new role. If survival depends on mutual aid, could an obligation to provide assistance—enshrined in treaties like the Outer Space Treaty—extend beyond emergencies to include resource sharing, like calories or radiation shielding? Could architecture itself embed these principles, where handrails, airlocks, or shared oxygen systems aren’t just practical necessities, but enforcers of interdependence?<br><br>

Then, there’s the question of governance. How resources like air and water are controlled will define the social and political structures of lunar life. Metering air could lead to hyper-individualism and scarcity-based economies, or it could push toward collective resource management. Legal frameworks already shape this future—while the Moon Treaty embeds mutualism, major space-faring nations don't ratify it, favouring competition over cooperation.<br><br>

Even something as simple as how we understand nature shifts. Would lunar inhabitants train themselves to see beauty in the Moon’s landscapes rather than longing for Earth’s greenery? Would they construct artificial environments, and if so, what aspects of nature are essential for well-being?<br><br>

Culture, identity, and media will also play a role. What holidays get recognised? What narratives will shape the idea of who belongs in space? Will lunar media develop independently or remain Earth-centric? And how does all of this shape the relationship between Earth and its off-world settlements?<br><br>

Ultimately, the Moon is more than an environment—it’s a social experiment in how constraints shape new forms of community, governance, and identity. Design is never neutral, and on the Moon, it may be the very thing that determines whether a society thrives, fractures, or redefines what it means to be human.<br><br>

    <aside class="notes">
    - Because the conversation was so rich, we decided—together with NSPDOS and the Santa Fe Institute’s Interplanetary Project—to expand it into a series of panels and design sprints.<br><br> 
    - They were called Lunar Denizens and they invovled once again a very eclectic crowed, from engineer to architects with links to the institute, to artist, strategist working within culture and other thinkers. Joseph Popper took part in our last panel actually.<br><br>
    - Each session focused more deeply on one of the situations I mentioned earlier, and built on the insights the previous session, and previous discussions. It became an iterative process, where each step refined and expanded our understanding from the previous panels and so on.

    <aside class="notes">
    - As we kept expanding these discussions, we weren’t just talking about the mechanics of settlement—we were questioning the very frameworks that shape how we perceive and organise life beyond Earth. This is where speculative cosmologies come in.<br><br>
    - So If speculative ethnographies explore how cultures could be imagined or reinterpreted, speculative cosmologies take this further and ask how do we construct entire worldviews? What stories, myths, knowledge and structures define our reality?<br><br>
    - Beyond the creation of myths; they are the frameworks through which people understand their place in the universe. By speculating on them, we’re not just imagining new worlds, we’re also questioning the foundations of the ones we already inhabit.

    <aside class="notes">
    - These conversations weren’t just theoretical—they showed how design doesn’t just respond to worlds but is a medium that actively materialises them. This isn’t about world-building anymore but rather world-making<br><br>
    - It is about shaping the material, relational, and experiential conditions through which realities emerge. By giving form to alternative ontologies and worldviews, design makes speculation tangible, embedding it within lived experience."

    <aside class="notes">
    - World-making through design isn’t just about what we build—it can take the form of records, sounds, or rituals. The Golden Record is one such example: an attempt to encapsulate human culture, yet at the same time, a reflection of the worldview of those who curated it.<br><br>

    <aside class="notes">
    - Engaging with materiality is always embedded in locality. It is situated, shaped by the environments, cultures, and conditions it emerges from—meaning that design, by its very nature, has the potential to be pluriversal, allowing for multiple ways of knowing and being to take shape.

    <aside class="notes">
    - One way I put this into practice is through Critical Fables.<br><br>
    - Critical Fables is a framework I use with my students, where we treat designed objects as narratives—not tied to a specific reality but crafted to engage with speculative or critical intent. These objects act as allegories, embedding moral lessons, tensions, and critiques within their materiality. They exist in the space between the real and the unreal, using fiction to reconfigure our relationship to reality and open up different ways of imagining the future.<br><br>
    - Unlike speculative prototypes or predictive models, Critical Fables are not about forecasting what is to come but about destabilising the assumptions that shape both present and future possibilities. <br><br>
    - To ground this framework, there are four key aspects that shape how Critical Fables function—each offering a way of engaging with design as a tool for storytelling, speculation, and critique.

    <aside class="notes">
    -  there’s Narrative as Critique—the idea that storytelling isn’t just a way of imagining, but a way of unmasking. Like traditional fables, these narratives embed moral lessons and allegories, allowing us to probe societal norms, power dynamics, and ethical dilemmas, and encourage us to question the narratives we take for granted.

    <aside class="notes">

    <aside class="notes">
    - Sonic Inquiry—because sound isn’t just something we hear; it’s something we experience, something that situates and frames. Sound and music-making are forms of intellectual exploration. They carry material and kinetic aesthetics that shape how we locate ourselves within a world, whether real or imagined.

    <aside class="notes">
    - And finally, Embodied Inquiry— as knowing comes from doing. Through role-playing, participatory experiences, and bodily engagement, Critical Fables turn sense-making into something physical. By stepping into a scenario, inhabiting a role, design rituals we create new relations to knowledge.
