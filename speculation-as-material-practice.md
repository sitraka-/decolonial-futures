<aside class="notes">
- Hello, my name is Sitraka Rakotoniaina.<br>
- I’m an artist-designer originally from Madagascar, now based in London.<br>
- I lecture at Central Saint Martins in MA Industrial Design and MA Narrative Environments.<br>
- I also teach at the London College of Fashion in MA Fashion Futures, and at Goldsmiths in MA Design Expanded Practice.<br>
- Outside of teaching, I run a small research and design studio called Very Very Far Away (VVFA).<br>
- And in parallel, I’m doing a PhD in Design at UAL.<br><br>
- Today, I’ll sketch four short segments on speculation:<br>
- First, the scope I’m interested in when it comes to speculative design practices.<br>
- Second, a framework I use with my students called *critical fables*.<br>
- Third, how speculation becomes a method for *practising friction*.<br>
- And finally, I’ll briefly share some outcomes and methods that emerge from these practices.

    <aside class="notes">
    - I want to begin with a certain tension in the way speculative futures are often imagined — especially in design.

    <aside class="notes">
    - There is a tendency to project forward using the forms and systems we already know. To treat the future as something to be rendered in detail, filled in with familiar logics: private property, zoning, productivity, control. These visions appear expansive, but they often narrow what is possible, replicating the very hierarchies they claim to move beyond.<br>
    - One image that that get shared over and over from Blue Origin's remake of O'neil's space settlements is the "space elk". There was something strangely deeply absurd. If this is our cosmic imaginary, then what exactly are we rehearsing?

    <aside class="notes">
    - What interests me is not just what these projections depict, but what they quietly assume. The agricultural systems, the infrastructure, the division of labour — all lifted more or less unchanged. The farms are still monocultures. The workers still shift-based. Gravity itself is faked so that business-as-usual can continue uninterrupted.
    - Even when framed as radical or off-world, these speculative futures continue to be tethered to deeply terrestrial logics. They present the new as a continuity of the same: technocratic control, extractive models, and spatial segregation dressed up in utopian skins.

 <aside class="notes">
    - This repetition isn’t exclusive to outer space. It exists in the way infrastructures on Earth have long been used to shape access, visibility, and value.<br>
    - A well-known example is Robert Moses’s parkway designs in New York. He built bridges deliberately low so that buses — and by extension, the people who relied on them — couldn’t pass through. What looked like a neutral engineering choice was in fact a form of social exclusion, making segregation feel like a natural outcome of infrastructure. Design here doesn’t simply respond to needs — it draws boundaries, filters bodies, encodes decisions. <br><br>

<section data-background-image="assets/imgs/cb2.jpg" data-state=cb1>
    <span class="quotes">The design process itself—beyond its final outcome—embodies and perpetuates power structures and ideologies. Through its functional, infrastructural, symbolic, and normative aspects, it establishes standards and normalises behaviours and practices.</span>
    <aside class="notes">
    - Much like metaphors can create "pictures" or conceptual frameworks that orient thinking, design functions as both an instrument and an infrastructure that shapes our aesthetic relations to the world. <br><br>
    - And by aesthetic, I don’t just mean the way things look, but the ways we perceive, sense, and experience the world around us.<br><br>
    - In essence, design is both a product of worldviews—reflecting existing ideologies—and a tool that frames and narrows but also possibly broadens how people construct new ones.

<section data-background-image="assets/imgs/cb2.jpg" data-state=cb1>
    <span class="quotes">Design serves as both an instrument of control<br>and a force that shapes what is considered<br><em>natural or inevitable.</em></span>
    <aside class="notes">
    - And this duality allows design to both reinforce or challenge, enhance or disrupt existing perspectives.<br><br>
    - So obviously design is never neutral. Every object, system, and interface carries with it the values, ideologies, and intentions of the forces that bring it into being. It is both an instrument of control and a agent that shapes what we come to see as natural or inevitable. <br><br>
    - So my work explores this duality, focusing on how it mediates our understanding of worlds, particularly when we extend our imaginations to outer space.

    <aside class="notes">
    - When thinking about approaches that imagine and experiment with alternative ways of being—rather than simply replicating existing structures in new contexts—Lisa Messeri’s use of material instantiation is particularly compelling. <br><br>
    - In her discussion of scientists working at the Mars Desert Research Station, she highlights how data becomes infused with narrative possibilities, turning raw information into rich stories. She frames this as a juxtaposition of Mars and Earth—two distinct places coexisting in the same space. <br><br>
    - Which creates a scenario where the boundaries between the two begin to blur, leading to a unique encounter of the real and the speculative.
