<aside class="notes">
    - Hello, my name is Sitraka Rakotoniaina,<br>
    - I am an Artist, designer originally from Madagascar and currently living and working in London.<br>
    - I'm in my 2nd year of PhD so still sort of early in the process, and things are a bit scattered everywhere. <br>
    - Going to read few bits and pieces sequenced in this presentation, so at least we have some kind of context or reason. My aim is to do 20 min talking max then show some projects and have a conversation about those, if you don't mind. <br>
    - My PhD is about speculative cosmologies, cosmic simulation as critical design practice. Cosmic as in meaning making, worldview and cultural imagination<br>
    How imagining new cosmologies explored through simulations can inform and guide us in engaging with the unknown, in making room for otherness, and difference?<br><br>
    And what I'm presenting today is the part that looks at how design acts as an instrument of cosmological expression, a way of materialising worldviews, shaping what is thinkable, and structuring how reality is experienced.<br><br>I’m interested in how design gives form to ideas, values, and systems—how it embeds imaginaries into tools, infrastructures, gestures, and environments. The projects I’ll be sharing explore that idea through sound, movement, machine perception and machine learning—where design operates between speculation and material constraint.

<aside class="notes">
    Currently most of my projects aren't aiming aiming for resolution or coherence, they often sit inbetween things, sometimes in contradictions. that's what I mean by this practising friction.<br><br>It’s a way of using it as a sort of method, where it becomes the space where new forms of sense-making emerge.

    <aside class="notes">
    - I’m not interested in imagination as something separate from systems, like a sort of poetic aside to technical function. Instead, I d'like to explore how imaginaries are woven into the fabric of systems: in machines that shape how we move, in tools that derive sounds and music from what we see, and so on.<br>
    - They shape what is designed, what is excluded, and what is made operational. A gesture, a sound, a rhythm can all be the outputs of logics inherited from elsewhere: scientific infrastructures, computational training sets, embedded values coded into how things function. <br>
    - Obviously, design does not sit outside of these structures, it works within them by reinforcing their assumptions or twisting their logic. in other words, systems are carriers of worldview. They embed logic, hierarchy, narrative. To design a system is to give form to an imaginary, to make it operational.</aside>

    <aside class="notes">
        I’m not interested in cosmologies as abstract belief systems floating above the world. Every cosmology is material not only in objects or artefacts, but in how it arranges life, bodies, actions. What matters to me is the affordances it enables, the behaviours it scripts, the relations it structures. The same way a policy has material consequences; it shapes who can move, who can breathe, who can speak. Even digital materials like data sets, interfaces, code, carry cosmological weight, shaping how the world is sensed, categorised, or made actionable. <br><br>Materials are not passive carriers of meaning; they are active participants in how cosmologies are enacted and felt. I'm interested in exploringe how ideas emerge through materials, and how materials carry, distort, or resist those ideas.

    <aside class="notes">
        Speculations are ways of working within realities differently. By imagining the world otherwise, we expose the assumptions that structure the present. Speculative gestures do not point toward distant futures. They ask what becomes visible when something breaks, when the normal is unsettled. <br><br>The work I'll be showing tries to engage with these tensions to maybe one day reveal a space for change.

    <aside class="notes">
    - I'll start with talking about design as the practice of transmuting ideas into tangible realities, and a method for imagining and spawning worlds, as the stories we tell, the imaginaries we create, and the ideological projects we hold all seep into the objects and materials around us. (you've prbably hear this kind of things many times before... sorry) <br><br>
    - And in turn, those materials shape how we see the world and imagine what’s possible.<br><br>
    - I’ll start with examples that illustrate the key dimensions I am interested in.<br><br>

    <span class="quotes">The design process itself, beyond its final outcome, embodies and perpetuates power structures and ideologies. Through its functional, infrastructural, symbolic, and normative aspects, it establishes standards and normalises behaviours and practices.</span>
    <aside class="notes">
    - Much like metaphors can create "pictures" or conceptual frameworks that orient thinking, design functions as both an instrument and an infrastructure that shapes our aesthetic relations to the world. <br><br>
    - And by aesthetic, I don’t just mean the way things look, but the ways we perceive, sense, and experience the world around us.<br><br>
    - In essence, design is both a product of worldviews—reflecting existing ideas—and a tool that frames and narrows but also possibly broadens how people construct new ones.

    <aside class="notes">
    - And this duality allows design to both reinforce or challenge, enhance or disrupt existing perspectives.<br><br>
    - So obviously design is never neutral. Every object, system, and interface carries with it the values and intentions of the forces that bring it into being. It is both an instrument of control and a agent that shapes what we come to see as natural or inevitable. <br><br>

Beyond the symbolic image of two superpowers able to collaborate together for the greater good of sicence despite the Cold War, both made the considered decision to get rid of the male and female parts in their docking system, a preemptive adjustment to avoid diplomatic penetration which could be seen as a sign of submission or weakness. <br><br>

    - Design is an assemblage—a dynamic constellation of ideas, practices, technologies, and social norms.

    - When thinking about approaches that imagine and experiment with alternative ways of being—rather than simply replicating existing structures in new contexts—Lisa Messeri’s use of material instantiation is particularly compelling. <br><br>
    -In her discussion of scientists working at the Mars Desert Research Station, she highlights how data becomes infused with narrative possibilities, turning raw information into rich stories. She frames this as a juxtaposition of Mars and Earth—two distinct places coexisting in the same space. <br><br>
    - Which creates a scenario where the boundaries between the two begin to blur, leading to a unique encounter of the real and the speculative.

    <aside class="notes">
    - So from this interplay of imaginaries, worldviews, and designs may emerge the potential for alternatives. And I'm interested in Speculative ethnographies as it offers a way to bring these ideas into tangible forms—reconstructing culture by blending heritage and fiction to reimagine what is possible, often as a way to assert agency over dominant narratives.

    - One example of this is the Hira Gasy. A traditional Malagasy performance that I use as an example of speculative ethnography in practice. Costumes from the Merina Kingdom of the 19th century drew on European military attire—jackets, trousers, and sashes.<br><br>
    - But they weren’t just copies. Instead, they were reinterpreted, woven with bold Malagasy patterns and colours that turned symbols of colonial authority into something uniquely local as an expression of identity and autonomy. <br><br>
    - Here, the Merina engaged in a speculative reimagining of ‘Europeanness,’ using design to assert cultural agency and resist imposed narratives.

    <aside class="notes">
    - Thinking about imagined cultures and how they are brought to life, I want to briefly talk about a panel discussion I organised with NSPDOS as part of the Virtual Italian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale of Architecture in 2021. Titled Human Consideration: Speculation on Lunar Habitation, this event brought together an architect, a litterature scholar, and an anthropologist—to explore the social, architectural, and communal realities of long-term life on the Moon.<br><br>
    - Rather than treating lunar habitation as purely an engineering challenge, NSPDOS developed a world-building premise, a stolen report from the year 2133, to reframe the problem. This allowed us to ask different kinds of questions: not just about survival, but about what kinds of societies and relationships could emerge in such an environment.<br><br>
    - From there, we charted a path toward exploring what it truly means to live beyond Earth—not just how it might work, but how it might shape existence itself.

    - Rather than constructing a world from the top down, I wanted to start from the small, the everyday—moments, interactions, and routines. Instead of defining a fully built setting, I structured the discussion around specific situations, prompting the panel to generate stories from them and letting the world emerge through those narratives.<br><br>

</section>

<section data-background-image="assets/imgs/1999.jpg" data-state=nspdos>
    <aside class="notes">
    - From these discussions, a series of key ideas emerged like:<br><br>
    - Designing for the Moon is not just about infrastructure—it’s about shaping entirely new ways of living. The built environment, policies, and governance structures don’t just determine survival; they actively shape social relationships, rhythms of life, and cultural values. On the Moon, everything is extreme—gravity, resources, isolation—which means that every design decision has consequences beyond function.<br><br>

For example, the way time is structured can reshape daily life. Instead of Earth’s standard 8-hour work-rest cycles, a lunar society could be structured around different hour blocks<br><br>

Health and safety policies could take on a new role. If survival depends on mutual aid, could an obligation to provide assistance—which is the terms used in treaties like the Outer Space Treaty—extend beyond emergencies to include resource sharing, like calories or radiation shielding? Could architecture itself embed these principles, where handrails, airlocks, or shared oxygen systems aren’t just practical necessities, but enforcers of interdependence?<br><br>

    An ongoing experiment in translating visual detection into real-time sound.
Developed through several iterations, including a version made for a collaboration with Nick Mortimer, this project uses object detection to generate MIDI-based audio directly from video input. Objects don’t produce symbolic meaning—they become active agents in a system that reads space, motion, and form as sonic events. The result isn’t a soundtrack but a live perceptual system: one that operates in the space between recognition and interpretation, generating a new logic of association between what is seen and what is heard.

Granular synthesis, emerging from academically and technologically abundant experimental contexts, disperses sonic fragments into lush textures, abstractions, and immersive atmospheres.<br><br>Granny Flips holds both in friction. The friction becomes performable—an ongoing negotiation of sonic meaning and material history.

    Cosmic Tuner operates within the shared latent space of text, and sound—where machine-learned associations don’t just describe the world but produce new rules for what can be recognised, connected, or rendered sensible.<br><br>

Rather than searching for fixed outputs, the tuner explores what happens when these modalities misalign—where translation falters, or meaning becomes unresolvable. Inspired by the misreading of a word like “laughter” as a mechanical tick-tock, the project uses such slippages to trace the boundaries of machinic understanding.<br><br>

Here, speculation happens not through fiction, but through misrecognition—inhabiting the friction between statistical reasoning and human sense-making. The tuner does not decode meaning, but but tunes into that space where new worlds become momentarily audible, before disappearing again into noise.

Although the space exists in hundreds of dimensions (often 512 or more), what I will show is a compressed projection—reduced to three dimensions, for us puny humans, so we can visualise and navigate it. What we see is a fragment of some reality, a diagram of machine understanding: a model of what the system believes belongs together, what it thinks is meaningful, and where its sense-making starts to break down.
