    <aside class="notes">
    I’m not interested in imagination as something separate from systems, a poetic aside to technical function, decorative or symbolic. Instead, I like to explore how imaginaries are woven into the fabric of systems: in machines that shape how we move, in tools that derive sounds and tracks from what we see.They shape what is designed, what is excluded, and what is made operational. A gesture, a sound, a rhythm can all be the outputs of logics inherited from elsewhere: scientific infrastructures, computational training sets, embedded values coded into how things function. Obviously, design does not sit outside these structures, it works within them by reinforcing their assumptions or twisting their logic. in other words, systems are carriers of worldview. They embed logic, hierarchy, narrative. To design a system is to give form to an imaginary, to make it operational.</aside>

    <aside class="notes">
        I’m not interested in cosmologies as abstract belief systems floating above the world. Every cosmology is material not only in objects or artefacts, but in how it arranges life, bodies, actions. What matters is the affordances it enables, the behaviours it scripts, the relations it structures. Even a policy has material consequences; it shapes who can move, who can breathe, who can speak. Even digital materials like data sets, interfaces, code, carry cosmological weight, shaping how the world is sensed, categorised, or made actionable. Materials are not passive carriers of meaning; they are active participants in how cosmologies are enacted and felt. I'm interested in exploringe how ideas emerge through materials, and how materials carry, distort, or resist those ideas.

    <aside class="notes">
        Speculations are not departures from reality, but ways of working within it differently. By imagining the world otherwise, we expose the assumptions that structure the present. A shift in movement, a distortion of sound, an unfamiliar interface—these speculative gestures do not point toward distant futures. They ask what becomes visible when something breaks, when the normal is unsettled. The work I'll be showing tries to engage with these tensions: navigating machine-trained latent spaces, building contraptions that rehearse impossible movements, and constructing sonic systems that unsettle what is heard, recognised, or believed to be possible. These are not exercises in fiction, but negotiations between constraint and potential to stretch existing systems until their limits reveal the space for change.
